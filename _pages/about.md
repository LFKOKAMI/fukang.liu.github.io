I have been an assistant professor at Tokyo Institute of Technology since April 1st, 2023. My research interest is mainly cryptanalysis, covering but not limited to the following topics:

 - MPC/FHE/ZK-friendly ciphers
 - hash functions
 - high-performance stream ciphers for 5G/6G systems
 - block ciphers
 - permutation-based primitives
 
 Currently, I am especially interested in 
 - algebraic attacks
 - SHA-3
 - SHA-2
 - RIPEMD-160
